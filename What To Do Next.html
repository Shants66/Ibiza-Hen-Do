      <h2>What To Do Next:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> <h5>BOOK YOUR FLIGHTS - flying out Thursday 14 August and back to London on Sunday 17 or Monday 18 August. Please let me know when you have booked your flights, so we know when people will be arriving at / leaving the villa. Check in-time is 3pm, so I would suggest a flight arriving in Ibiza early or mid afternoon on Thursday 14 August. For those that won't be taking Thursday off work, any evening flight works. We'll make sure we're back at the villa to welcome you!</h5></li>
        <li> <h5>RECOMMENDATIONS - please let me know if you have any beach club or club recommendations. We will probably need to get club tickets in advance. Am thinking we should try and get VIP tickets for the Friday night (with drinks included), so will see what deals we can find.</h5></li>
        <li> <h5>PAYMENTS - I have already paid for the villa. Assuming there are 10 of us, the villa is approx £315 per person. When we have booked the boat trip and the clubs, we can sort out payment. It would be great if everyone could also pay £100 towards the kitty for food and drinks for the villa.</h5></li>
